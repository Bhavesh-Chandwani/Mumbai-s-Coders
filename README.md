# **🧩 Problem Statement**: 

Modern social platforms collect huge amounts of user data such as personal details, friendships, and page interactions. However, without proper analysis and processing, this raw data remains unstructured, inconsistent, and difficult to use for meaningful insights.

This project focuses on building an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) system using pure Python (no external libraries) to understand, clean, and utilize a social-network-style dataset. The goal is to transform raw, messy data into structured information and then use it to generate intelligent insights such as friend suggestions and page recommendations.

The key challenges addressed in this project include:

    - Handling missing, duplicate, inconsistent, and unstandardized data.

    - Efficiently transforming user IDs into readable names using dictionary lookups.

    - Building logic-driven recommendation features without relying on advanced libraries.

    - Extracting meaningful patterns purely using Python’s core data structures.

This project demonstrates how powerful Python can be for data manipulation, cleaning, and basic recommendation systems — even without external tools like Pandas or NumPy.
